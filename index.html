        <h2 style="color: firebrick;">What is a gold digger?</h2>
        <p>A gold digger is someone who pursues and forms a relationship with someone else for the sole purpose of using
            or taking that person’s money and wealth. The gold digger doesn’t have an honest emotional or physical
            attraction to their partner; rather, their goal is to enter into a relationship in order to have access to
            the target’s wealth.

            While anyone can be a gold digger, and the gender and age dynamic can vary, the stereotypical gold digger
            relationship is of a young woman who goes after an older, richer man. She either waits for the older man to
            die to inherit his wealth, files for divorce and tries to obtain money through legal proceedings, or will
            simply stay in the relationship and take advantage of it while providing as little in return as possible.

        <h2 style="color: firebrick;">signs of a gold digger</h2>
        <p>Gold diggers can take various different approaches to find and court their targets. However, there are some
            common signs that can indicate someone is in a relationship for financial gain.</p><br>

        <h2 style="color: firebrick">Dealing with a Gold Digger</h2>
        <p>If you believe that you are in a relationship with a gold digger, you will have to decide how to proceed.
            The
            best way to move forward may be to cut off the relationship. This can be hard, however, if you’ve fallen
            in
            love or there are other outstanding circumstances — if they are a co-parent to your children, for
            example —
            that would make it tough to sever all ties.</p>

        <h2 style="color:crimson">How to Be a Gold Digger</h2>
        <p>Whether we approve or not, many people wish (sometimes subconsciously or quietly) to find someone who
            can
            be a "breadwinner" for various reasons – so they can stay home to raise children, focus on a dream
            career that has yet to produce reliable income, or simply for material comfort.[1] And as more women
            become financially successful, fewer of them are interested in "gold digging", but male "gold
            diggers"
            are becoming more common.[2] If you feel that financial security is the most important factor in
            choosing a partner to share your life with, you can (and should) approach the matter with
            sensibility
            and charm.</p>

        <h3 style="color:crimson; font-size: 23px;">Signs of gold digger women</h3>
        <div style="color: black;">
            <p>Spotting a gold digger earlier in the relationship can help you bail out before it’s too late. Here are
                ten signs of a gold digger woman you may want to watch out for.</p>
            <br>

            <ol>
                <li>She has gold digger friends</li>
                <p>One sign that you may be dating a gold digger is if all her friends’ date and marry rich guys. Just
                    like the saying, “Birds of the same feather flock together,” gold diggers are more likely to hang
                    out with fellow gold diggers.</p>
                <li>She is not emotionally attached</li>
                <p>More often than not, women get emotionally attached to their partners. They love to show affection to
                    men that they truly like.

                    However, this may not be the case if they are just after your money. A gold digger wife is more
                    attached to your money, and this is her motivation to do and say the right things. But you may never
                    hear from them as soon as the money is over</p>
                <li>Puts more value on expensive gifts</li>
                <p>Sentimental and thoughtful gifts could mean a lot to a woman that really likes you. However, if she
                    is only in a relationship with you because of money, she will not accept any gift that does not have
                    a monetary value. For them, it is less about thoughtful gifts and more about expensive gifts.</p>
                <li>Prefers an expensive gift for an apology</li>
                <p>When you have a gold digger for a girlfriend, all you need is to buy them an expensive gift to
                    resolve an argument. Instead of sitting down to solve the issue, they would rather have you buy them
                    something of a high monetary value.

                    Also, some gold digger women may initiate stupid fights just so that you can buy them gifts to
                    apologize. No matter how mad they were, getting them an expensive gift will surely impress them.</p>

                <li>She only hangs out in fancy places</li>
                <p>Most of the time, a gold digger will only want to hang out in expensive joints. Being a gold digger
                    goes hand in hand in accepting only the finer things in life.

                    A gold-digging woman will choose the fanciest places usually reserved for special occasions like
                    anniversaries or birthdays. Some will ask to go somewhere expensive on the first date just to see if
                    you can manage their lifestyle.</p>
                <li>She is curious about your income</li>
                <p>Expect a gold digger to ask where you work, your position, where you live, and your income status out
                    of curiosity. It is okay to know this information, especially if you intend to get serious with a
                    gold digger in a relationship.

                    Unfortunately, most women inquire too much about your income to decide whether they will stay with
                    you or not. Therefore, it may be a red flag if she questions your financial situation on the first
                    or second date.</p>
                <li>She doesn’t pay for anything</li>
                <p>It is natural for men to foot the bill when on dates, particularly at the start of a relationship.
                    Nevertheless, you should be concerned if your partner is not bothered to contribute or offer to pay
                    the bill.

                    You may be having a gold digger on your hands if they are too comfortable not splitting the bill or
                    catering to their expenses. One of gold diggers tactics is to use reverse psychology to justify
                    their actions.

                    Most gold diggers will insist that a real man should cater for all bills. If you intend to take your
                    relationship to another stage, bring up the subject and discourage the behavior as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <li>She is ungrateful and entitled</li>
                <p>A gold digger woman may have a sense of entitlement and don’t feel the need to work for anything.
                    Also, they lack gratitude and may take everything for granted, and that includes you. Because of
                    their entitled and ungrateful attitude, you will never hear words such as “Thank you” or “Please.”

                    On the same note, watch out for ill-mannered behaviors as they try to prove that they are
                    financially superiors to others. For instance, they may be rude to waiters and are total snobs with
                    people of a less social standard.</p>
                <li>Always in a financial crisis</li>
                <p>Does she keep asking for favors to solve her financial crisis? After several dates of knowing each
                    other, if you want to know a gold digger, she will say she has a financial emergency after several
                    dates of knowing each other.

                    This may become a trend and a quick way on how to spot a gold digger.

                    You can expect that they will be in a financial crisis now and then. Suddenly, their laptop has
                    crashed, they need a new phone or need to repair their car. Once you notice this pattern, then you
                    are dating a gold digger.</p>
                <li>She is out of your league</li>
                <p>The other tip on how to find a gold digger is if she is way beyond your league. Of course, love has
                    no boundary. However, some signs may show she is beyond your league and may not be in the
                    relationship for genuine reasons.

                    For instance, some younger women have different reasons for dating older men, with some claiming
                    that they want a more mature and established man. Nevertheless, chances are they are dating an older
                    man for money and keeping an attractive younger man that will meet their sexual and social needs.

            <h2 style="color:crimson; font-size: 30px;">Signs of gold digger men</h2>
            <div style="color: whitesmoke;">
                <p>Unlike popular belief, many men are gold diggers and are in relationships where they can benefit
                    financially. As absurd as this may sound, men gold diggers will want you to cater for all the
                    expenses and even shower him with expensive gifts. Here are the warning signs of a gold digger man.
                </p>
                <li>He always asks about your finances</li>
                <p>If your boyfriend always brings up topics about your finances and investments, then it is a surefire
                    sign that he is a gold digger. Your boyfriend should enjoy spending quality time talking about your
                    likes, qualities, and other essential things about your relationship in normal circumstances.

                    While it is essential to also talk about finances, it becomes a call for concern when your partner
                    is always interested in your money because he has an ulterior motive. Therefore, you can know the
                    motive by the things gold diggers say.</p>
                <li>He always experiences financial emergencies</li>
                <p>Like gold digger women, getting various emergencies that need money is a characteristic of a gold
                    digger man. In most cases, such men use reverse psychology and appear manipulative when asking you
                    for money.

                    A boyfriend who is a gold digger is overly concerned about other people and wants to help them but
                    gives excuses for why they can’t find the money. Expect to be introduced to family and friends in
                    dire need but whom you will never hear or see again.</p>
                <li>He is not ambitious</li>
                <p>Beware of a partner who has no job and is not interested in finding one soon. They have no grand plan
                    and are rarely driven to do something constructive; instead, they just want to enjoy life.

                    A man who is not career-oriented will depend on you to pay for everything. Some of these male gold
                    diggers have attractive looks, and they may leverage this to get your hard-earned money and spend it
                    on themselves and others.</p>
                <li>Lies about his job</li>
                <p>Similarly, a gold digger guy may lie about his job and portray himself to be successful.

                    He may even lie about having issues at his place of work to earn your pity and get you to pay for
                    his bills. But have you visited his business or office to know if he is genuinely working or he is
                    just a parasite that is in a relationship with you just for money?</p>
                <li>He pays for things at first and then never again</li>
                <p>Just like any perfect gentleman, a gold digger man will take you on dates and insist on paying for
                    everything. They tend to be charming on the first few dates until you are emotionally invested.
                    Before you know it, they would have made a swift turn and started depending on you to pay for
                    everything.

                    He will start giving excuses on why he can’t pay, like leaving his wallet in the car. To avoid
                    embarrassment, you will take up the financial burden and slowly become accustomed to this.</p>
                <li>He is always curious about your family background</li>
                <p>Some male gold diggers ask too many questions to know about your family background. Such men will try
                    to please you in every way, including taking you out on dates and holidays and eventually marrying
                    you.

                    Unfortunately, such a man may damp you as soon as he has laid his hands on your inheritance.</p>
                <li>He loves shopping and getting gifts from you</li>
                <p>Another tip on how to catch a gold digger is by listening to what they have to say when it comes to
                    money and investments. A man that is out for your money will always encourage you to go shopping and
                    even volunteer to take you.

                    When out shopping, he will add expensive items to your shopping basket and make a 180 when you reach
                    the counter. They will also encourage you to purchase things that will benefit them, even if it’s
                    not your preference.</p>
                <li>He becomes agitated when you say no</li>
                <p>Beware of guys that get angry when you say no to their financial requests. This is especially true
